"""
An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with
your testing of the program.

ï‚· The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to
  be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised

Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees 
Fahrenheit. Since 0Â° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative 
temperature
